IDSN 599 Assignment 2 - Clicker Game
Using what I know about variables, functions, structs, conditions and other programming fundamentals, I created a simple cat clicker game.
User clicks on the cat emoji and based on certain thresholds, the cat displays a mood paired with a speech bubble.
User can click "restart" to reset the amount of clicks and play again. Pet the cat to your hearts desire!
